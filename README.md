## **Abstract**

## **1. Introduction & Problem Statement**

### **1.1 The Current NFT Landscape**

The NFT ecosystem is growing rapidly, yet discovery and monetization remain significant challenges. Many creators struggle to gain visibility, and users find it difficult to explore high-quality content due to algorithm-driven and ad-focused platforms.

### **1.2 Challenges in the Space**

- **Ad-Based Revenue Models**: Traditional platforms prioritize ad revenue, leading to clickbait and low-quality content.
- **Lack of Visibility for Creators**: Original artists have difficulty standing out in oversaturated marketplaces.
- **Limited User Engagement**: Many platforms push content based on engagement algorithms rather than genuine interest.
- **Inequitable Revenue Distribution**: Creators receive minimal earnings while centralized platforms take the majority of profits.

Glass aims to solve these problems by introducing a **decentralized, interest-driven curation system** that rewards both users and creators.

## **2. Solution Overview: What is Glass?**

Glass is a decentralized content-sharing platform where users can:

- **Curate and share NFTs** through interactive boards.
- **Engage in microtransactions** (pinning/voting) that directly benefit creators.
- **Discover high-quality content** without ad-driven algorithms.
- **Leverage Web3 technologies** for transparency, security, and decentralization.

Glass provides a **sustainable, creator-first economy** where users participate meaningfully in content discovery and monetization.

## **3. Technical Architecture**

### **3.1 Smart Contracts & Transaction Flow**

Glass operates using **Hedera Smart Contracts** to facilitate seamless microtransactions. The core components include:

- **Glassboard Contracts** – Manage curated NFT collections and user interactions.
- **Glasspin NFTs** – Represent pinned content and serve as an incentive mechanism.
- **Voting System** – Users vote on NFTs to enhance discoverability and visibility.
- **Fee Distribution** – A portion of every transaction is distributed to creators and board owners.

### **3.2 IPFS & Decentralized Storage**

- All images and metadata are permanently stored on **IPFS via Pinata**, ensuring censorship resistance and long-term accessibility.

### **3.3 Security & Smart Contract Audits**

- **Code audits** will be conducted to ensure security and prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Hedera’s robust infrastructure** provides high throughput, finality, and low transaction fees, making it ideal for microtransactions.

## **4. Economic Model & Monetization**

Glass introduces a **self-sustaining economic model** where users actively contribute to the ecosystem:

- **Pinning Fees**: Users pay a small fee to pin NFTs to their boards.
- **Revenue Distribution**: Fees are split between the original NFT creator and the board owner.
- **Voting System**: Users can vote for content, enhancing visibility.
